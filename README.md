# Indentured Servitude, Revisited

## Summary
In this paper, we examine the potentially adverse effects student loans have on an individual's ability to accumulate assets. We also explore the possible ramifications that these effects might have on future borrowers.

## Files Description
From thesis_main.py, we call functions from ts_prepping.py, clust_funcs.py, and miscellaneous.py and, using the 'subprocess' module, we run the modeling as well as some of the time series tests in R (see: modeling.R and unit_root_test.R).
